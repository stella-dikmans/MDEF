# design spaces

my weak signals are: “fight Anthropocene conflicts”, “technology for equality”, and “inter-species collaboration”.
my areas of opportunity are: “multi-scalar thinking”, “environmental sensing”, “co-creation”.
additionally, I included “narrative creation”, “environmental health”, and “universal rights” into my most important set of terms.

for my high school finals in 2016, I wrote a piece on the potential of the concept and term "Anthropocene" to bring climate change and environmental health to the center of social and political discourses. this was shortly before a 34-member team at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town confirmed the theses on anthropological impacts and its own valid terminology. in 2020, I dealt with the effects of the social environment on one's own environmental attitude in my sociology bachelor's thesis, again investigating with the human being in focus. only at art college, I started to incorporate my more-than-human interests into my professional practice. I began reading Le Guin and Haraway and exhibited an installation at DDW2021 about the fragile but essential importance of Earth’ “air” to living organisms. I am now convinced that humans cannot be the sole center of enquiry, as this would exclude many very potent areas of research. we must think, sense, and investigate on multiple scales, which includes observing non-human narratives and their experiences. ultimately, climate change and environmental health are stories shaped by more than one narrative.

my practice seeks for an equal distribution of the impacts of climate change and expansive responses to them by fueling the multiplicity of more-than-human narrations. I want to learn how to design balanced relationships that embody synergies, acknowledging that the interconnected whole is far more than the sum of its parts. this is all the same place, one world with all its differences and human and non-human organisms that are equally worth protecting and thriving. I observe that political discourses are stuck in their monophonic stories and easily lose sight of essential needs such as access to clean air, drinking water, and balanced nutrition.

when it came to contextualizing myself in my environment, I re-realized my interests with water consumption. the tap water in my house tastes strongly of chlorine and in social events I often find myself talking about the best water-filter to install in sinks or bottles. I am impressed by the large number of public wells in the city. I have taken to bike with my empty bottle, saving weight and just stopping whenever I feel the need to drink. I never lived in a city in which water was so easily available. I remember in Berlin a start-up once tried to convince shops and restaurants to allow people to fill up their bottles with tap water without charging them. I think it failed. is it right that I am impressed by the supply of such basic need?

my parents took me and my brother camping in nature from an early age. there was no tap, no socket, the nearest well was a 30-minute walk away I remember the sun burning hot on our backs, the five-liter bottles we tossed around on the way to the well, now heavy and full in our hands so that they hurt the insides of our hands. we knew exactly how best to wash ourselves; we found out that the best technique to wash the dishes without soap (at that time natural soaps were not so common) is to scrub with soil and grasses and then just gently rinse with water while brushing your teeth with the same water.  I also remember buying water to drink at the shop. as a very migraine-prone family, my mother always made sure that we didn't run out of drinking water.  yet, for a family of four at 30 degrees in the shade, it was quite a few liters that we would consume in a day - that is, in a week.
I think I had my first culture shock when I was 16, arriving back from a four month stay on the forests near Chiang Mai, Thailand to my parents’ house in Berlin, Germany. I went to the bathroom and realized for the first time in my life that I had been flushing away my excrements with drinking water. and not only that but by throwing soft-washed paper unto the water, I polluted it, so that it meant an enormous effort to filter, clean and treat the water before it could be used again in the tap water system of this city.

the following design-spaces are based on these experiences and the resulting interests. it is hard for me to choose, narrow-down and focus on one line of thought, therefore the many sprouting roots that search still seek for connectivity…
